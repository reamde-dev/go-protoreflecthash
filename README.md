# protoreflecthash

protoreflecthash is a re-implementation of
<https://github.com/deepmind/objecthash-proto>.  That repo is now archived and
was never updated for [protobuf-apiv2](https://go.dev/blog/protobuf-apiv2).

This package is currently experimental; the hash values for messages will likely
change without warning until v1.
